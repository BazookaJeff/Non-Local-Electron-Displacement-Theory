I apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors. This is the first iteration of the paper and I will continue to work on it. Unfortunately, I am not sure how much time I will have to work on this project as I have two aneurysms which incidently have caused me to publish this paper much earlier than I anticipated. My hope is that bright minds will entertain this theory as I think it has merit and can propel us into a brighter future. Please download a copy of it as well for I am also unsure what might happen in the future if I am indeed correct.
