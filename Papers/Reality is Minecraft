Reality is Minecraft
By: BazookaJeff
The Pyramids at Giza stand as one of the greatest enigmas in human history until now. If any society were to harbor a great secret, it would be the Egyptians. Reality is a simulation. Plato tells us that copies of reality are on walls of caves. Binary is how we build simulations on computers. There ought to be evidence for this in reality – there is. A zero and a one. That is binary. We see this in reality in electrons. A particle (one) and a wave (zero). What’s interesting is we can influence it i.e. double slit experiment. How does this relate to Giza? Pyramidal structures focus electromagnetic energy. We are electromagnetic and we can influence particles. Giza used hydrochloric acid and hydrated zinc to make hydrogen – electrons. I wager the pharaoh utilized this to make reality as he saw fit. 
“No. They have all kinds of shapes - they are a function of the star around which they cluster, and some of them can make shape changes. Is it biologically reasonable?

Yes. Here is an example that you will understand immediately – [He] points to the heavy wooden table between us. ‘It's a table, yes? It's made of atoms. And if the nucleus of the atom is here on the table - do you know where its electron is? Maybe in Rosh Pina, maybe in the middle of nothing. It's quantum theory; the material is empty. But you and I do not know how to turn this table into something else now. But we too are energy. Even when we die we do not die, because we are made of molecules and atoms, and we move to another energy. You connect back to the cosmic fabric, to the web, to the connection of consciousnesses. You are consciousness.’”
