Experiment 3: Focusing Electron Shells

Materials: 
Neodymium magnet bar
Cathode Ray Tube Television

Instructions: 
1.	Take neodymium magnet and put flat against CRT TV while on a static channel
2.	Take a second neodymium magnet and push against other magnet with opposing polarity
a.	You will notice the electron shells become smaller and more packed together when magnets are increasingly forced together
b.	You will notice that electrons are flowing into the magnets from top and bottom like an hourglass i.e. the static will be darker and going into the electron shells
